In the ten Tusscher et al. model, dividing by C_m has already been factored into the maximal conductance parameters for the various currents.  Therefore, the units for I_total are (nS/pF)mV or equivalently mV/ms. I_axial also has units of mV/ms, because 1/(rho*S*C_m) (written as the Diffusion constant here) has units of cm^2/ms, as explained above.  For more details on the derivation of these formulas, look at the book "Mathematical Physiology 1: Cellular Physiology" Second Edition by Keener and Sneyd, the article "Instabilities of a Propagating Pulse in a Ring of Excitable Media" 1993 by Courtemanche, Glass, and Keener, and my notes from 9-22-17. */
